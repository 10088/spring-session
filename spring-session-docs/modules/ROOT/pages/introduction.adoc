Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information while also making it trivial to support clustered sessions without being tied to an application container-specific solution.
It also provides transparent integration with:

* xref:http-session.adoc#httpsession[HttpSession]: Allows replacing the `HttpSession` in an application container-neutral way, with support for providing session IDs in headers to work with RESTful APIs.
* xref:web-socket.adoc#websocket[WebSocket]: Provides the ability to keep the `HttpSession` alive when receiving WebSocket messages
* xref:web-session.adoc#websession[WebSession]: Allows replacing the Spring WebFlux's `WebSession` in an application container-neutral way.
