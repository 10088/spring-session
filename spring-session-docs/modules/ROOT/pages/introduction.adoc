Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information while also making it trivial to support clustered sessions without being tied to an application container-specific solution.
It also provides transparent integration with:

* <<httpsession,HttpSession>>: Allows replacing the `HttpSession` in an application container-neutral way, with support for providing session IDs in headers to work with RESTful APIs.
* <<websocket,WebSocket>>: Provides the ability to keep the `HttpSession` alive when receiving WebSocket messages
* <<websession,WebSession>>: Allows replacing the Spring WebFlux's `WebSession` in an application container-neutral way.
