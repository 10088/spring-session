[[minimum-requirements]]
== Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements for Spring Session are:

* Java 8+.
* If you run in a Servlet Container (not required), Servlet 3.1+.
* If you use other Spring libraries (not required), the minimum required version is Spring 5.0.x.
* `@EnableRedisHttpSession` requires Redis 2.8+. This is necessary to support <<api-redisindexedsessionrepository-expiration,Session Expiration>>
* `@EnableHazelcastHttpSession` requires Hazelcast 3.6+. This is necessary to support <<api-enablehazelcasthttpsession-storage,`FindByIndexNameSessionRepository`>>

NOTE: At its core, Spring Session has a required dependency only on `spring-jcl`.
For an example of using Spring Session without any other Spring dependencies, see the <<samples,hazelcast sample>> application.
